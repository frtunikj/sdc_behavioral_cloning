Overview
---
This repo contains the code written to complete the third project "Behavioral Cloning" of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. This project consists of algorithms that gets as input camera images, processes the images with a neural network model implemented in Keras and predicts a steering angle for the autonomous vehicle as an output. 

About the project
---
An explanation of the files in this repository, the processing pipeline for behavioral cloning, as well as suggestions for further improvements can be found [here](https://github.com/frtunikj/sdc_behavioral_cloning/blob/master/writeup.md). 

Goals of the project
---
The goals / steps of this project were the following:
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report

Project environment installation
---
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

The following resources are available in the Udacity github repository:
* drive.py
* video.py
* writeup_template.md

The Udacity simulator was used for generating training data and for testing the automated driving. 

NOTE: The last Linux version of the simulator was not working on my VM Linux. I used one that was available on the slack channel: https://files.slack.com/filespri/T2HQV035LF3A47CT7Z/download/simulatorlinux.zip.
